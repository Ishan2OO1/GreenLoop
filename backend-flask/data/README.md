# Data Directory

This directory contains the training data and any other data files used in the project.

## Files:
- `training_data.csv` - The dataset used to train the ML model
- Add any other data files here as needed

## Purpose:
- Provides reproducibility by storing the original training data
- Can be used for model validation, testing, or retraining
- Reference for understanding the data structure and features

## Usage:
The data files in this directory are mainly for reference and reproducibility.
The Flask API doesn't directly use these files during prediction.
